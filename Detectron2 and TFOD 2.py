# What types of tasks does Detectron2 support?
Detectron2 supports object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, and panoptic segmentation.

# Why is data annotation important when training object detection models?
Accurate annotations provide ground truth for training, ensuring the model learns correct object locations and labels.

# What does batch size refer to in the context of model training?
Batch size is the number of training samples processed before updating model weights.

# What is the purpose of pretrained weights in object detection models?
Pretrained weights provide a starting point, reducing training time and improving performance on small datasets.

# How can you verify that Detectron2 was installed correctly?
Run: `import detectron2; print(detectron2.__version__)`. A successful import indicates proper installation.

# What is TFOD2, and why is it widely used?
TFOD2 (TensorFlow Object Detection API v2) is a framework for building, training, and deploying object detection models efficiently.

# How does learning rate affect model training in Detectron2?
A proper learning rate ensures faster convergence. Too high or too low values can hinder training.

# Why might Detectron2 use PyTorch as its backend framework?
PyTorch offers dynamic computation graphs, flexibility, and robust GPU acceleration.

# What types of pretrained models does TFOD2 support?
TFOD2 supports models like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, EfficientDet, and CenterNet.

# How can data path errors impact Detectron2?
Incorrect paths to datasets can lead to failed training or inference.

# What is Detectron2?
Detectron2 is Facebook AI’s open-source framework for advanced object detection and segmentation.

# What are TFRecord files, and why are they used in TFOD2?
TFRecord files store serialized data, making data handling efficient during training.

# What evaluation metrics are typically used with Detectron2?
Metrics include mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision, Recall, and Intersection over Union (IoU).

# How do you perform inference with a trained Detectron2 model?
Load the model using `DefaultPredictor`, pass an image, and access predictions through the `predictor` object.

# What does TFOD2 stand for, and what is it designed for?
TensorFlow Object Detection API v2, designed for building and deploying object detection models.

# What does fine-tuning pretrained weights involve?
Fine-tuning adapts pretrained weights to a new dataset by training on task-specific data.

# How is training started in TFOD2?
Run: `python model_main_tf2.py --pipeline_config_path=<path_to_config> --model_dir=<output_dir>`.

# What does COCO format represent, and why is it popular in Detectron2?
COCO format is a JSON schema for image annotations widely used for compatibility with benchmark datasets.

# Why is evaluation curve plotting important in Detectron2?
It visualizes metrics like loss and accuracy, aiding in model performance analysis.

# How do you configure data paths in TFOD2?
Set paths in `pipeline.config` for dataset, checkpoints, and output directories.

# Can you run Detectron2 on a CPU?
Yes, though GPU acceleration is recommended for faster training and inference.

# Why are label maps used in TFOD2?
Label maps define class names and IDs for consistent mapping during training and inference.

# How does batch size impact GPU memory usage?
Larger batch sizes consume more memory; reduce batch size if out-of-memory errors occur.

# What makes TFOD2 popular for real-time detection tasks?
TFOD2 supports fast, efficient models like SSD and YOLO optimized for real-time performance.

# What’s the role of Intersection over Union (IoU) in model evaluation?
IoU measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth boxes, evaluating detection accuracy.

# What is Faster R-CNN, and does TFOD2 support it?
Faster R-CNN is a two-stage detector with RPN. TFOD2 supports it as a backbone model.

# How does Detectron2 use pretrained weights?
Pretrained weights initialize the model for faster convergence and better performance.

# What file format is typically used to store training data in TFOD2?
TFRecord format is commonly used for serialized and efficient data storage.

# What is the difference between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation?
Semantic segmentation labels each pixel by class; instance segmentation separates objects of the same class.

# Can Detectron2 detect custom classes during inference?
Yes, after training on a dataset with the custom classes defined.

# Why is pipeline.config essential in TFOD2?
It specifies model, training, and evaluation parameters.

# What type of models does TFOD2 support for object detection?
TFOD2 supports single-stage (SSD, YOLO) and two-stage (Faster R-CNN) models.

# What happens if the learning rate is too high during training?
The model may diverge, failing to converge to an optimal solution.

# What is COCO JSON format?
A standardized JSON schema for object detection annotations compatible with COCO datasets.

# Why is TensorFlow Lite compatibility important in TFOD2?
It enables model deployment on edge devices for real-time applications with limited resources.
